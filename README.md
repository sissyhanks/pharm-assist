## Description
Pharm-Assist is a userfriendly app designed to track user medications ,schedule&dosage . Our app does the following 
* Prints a  Portable Document Format (PDF) for users to share the above info with providers
* Compare  medications and says about their interactions
* Provides comparative low drug prices at local pharmacies by zipcode

Motivation behind this work  is  a real life situation of a family member in our team who  had to take  medications prescribed by different providers  which kept changing frequently .And felt “Would'nt it be nice to have a hardcopy (pdf) of updated medlist with dosage and  schedule to be given to various providers.And ,thus our app was born!!!
